# Elasticsearch Monitor

It's my intention to create a few neat tools here for ElasticSearch but first we need to make the environment.  I'm going to do a series of tutorials on how to set things up, and if you don't have a lot of experience with ElasticSearch then using these tools as a guide should give you a running start to be a bit more comfortable with Elastic.

As this project matures, I'll post writeups on how to use these projects.

Please head over to the [Tutorials](./Tutorials/) section to see how it's coming along.
