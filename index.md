# Hello

Hi, I'm Jer.  I've had an interesting and varied career in DBA and Development, but most of what I enjoy has to do with data modelling, data integration, and visualizations with large datasets.  I enjoy solving problems that don't always have a *right* answer, just an *optimal* answer.  My passion is taking complex pieces of data and relationships and surfacing those through elegant APIs for developers or data discovery tools for ops teams and end users.

I've been writing code and documentation for a few years, but I'm just getting started uploading things to Github.  For now, I'm going to start with a few tutorials on setting up linux, ElasticSearch, and a few other utilities.  I've been looking for a good format for a technical blog for a while but I don't really like any of the things CMSs offer, they're either too much or too little.  It looks like Github Pages and the simplicity of markdown may be a sweet spot that I can work with.

For now, please head over to the [Tutorials](./Tutorials/) section to see how it's coming along.
