# Welcome

I've been writing code and documentation for a few years, but I'm just getting started uploading things to Github.  For now, I'm going to start with a few tutorials on setting up linux, elasticsearch, etc.  I've been looking for a good format for a technical blog for a while but I don't really like any of the things CMSs offer, they're either too much or too little.  It looks like Github Pages and the simplicity of markdown may be a sweet spot that I can work with.

For now, please head over to the [Tutorials](./Tutorials/) section to see how it's coming along.
